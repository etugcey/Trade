Python Trading Bot with Backtest (Binance API) by Chat GPT

Let's go through each section of the code and its purpose:

1. Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries, including backtrader, configparser, rarfile, getpass, os, and the Client class from binance.client.

2. extract_config Function: Define a function to extract the content of config.ini from the password-protected RAR archive.

3. Prompt User for RAR Password: Prompt the user to enter the password for the RAR archive using getpass.getpass.

4. Extract API Keys from RAR: Extract the content of config.ini using the extract_config function, supplying the RAR archive path and the provided password. Parse the API keys from the config content.

5. Define Simple Strategy: Define the SimpleStrategy class that implements a basic trading strategy based on a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover.

6. Backtesting and Live Trading: Depending on the mode chosen by the user, either perform backtesting or live trading. Set up the backtesting engine, fetch historical data from Binance (for backtesting), add the data feed, strategy, and set broker parameters. Perform the backtest or live trading, print portfolio values, and plot the backtest results (for backtesting). After the backtest or live trading, remove the extracted config.ini file using os.remove.
