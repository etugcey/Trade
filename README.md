# Python Trading Bot with Backtest (Binance API) by Chat GPT

### CODE EXPLAINED:

Let's go through each section of the code and its purpose:

1. Importing Libraries: 
   Import necessary libraries for the code to work: backtrader for backtesting, configparser for reading configuration files, rarfile for extracting RAR archives, getpass for secure password input, os for file operations, and Client from binance.client for Binance API interaction.

```python
import backtrader as bt
import configparser
import rarfile
import getpass
import os
from binance.client import Client
```
2. Defining extract_config Function

Define a function extract_config to extract the content of the config.ini file from a password-protected RAR archive.
This function takes two parameters: rar_path (path to the RAR archive) and password (password for the archive).
It uses the rarfile library to open the RAR archive, set the password, and read the content of config.ini.
The extracted content is returned as a string.

```python
def extract_config(rar_path, password):
    """
    Extracts the content of 'config.ini' from the password-protected RAR archive.
    
    :param rar_path: Path to the password-protected RAR archive.
    :param password: Password for the RAR archive.
    :return: Content of 'config.ini' as a string.
    """
    with rarfile.RarFile(rar_path) as rar:
        rar.setpassword(password.encode('utf-8'))
        with rar.open('config.ini') as config_file:
            config_content = config_file.read()
    return config_content.decode('utf-8')
```
3. Prompt User for RAR Password: Prompt the user to enter the password for the RAR archive using getpass.getpass.

4. Extract API Keys from RAR: Extract the content of config.ini using the extract_config function, supplying the RAR archive path and the provided password. Parse the API keys from the config content.

5. Define Simple Strategy: Define the SimpleStrategy class that implements a basic trading strategy based on a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover.

6. Backtesting and Live Trading: Depending on the mode chosen by the user, either perform backtesting or live trading. Set up the backtesting engine, fetch historical data from Binance (for backtesting), add the data feed, strategy, and set broker parameters. Perform the backtest or live trading, print portfolio values, and plot the backtest results (for backtesting). After the backtest or live trading, remove the extracted config.ini file using os.remove.

### SECURITY PRECAUTIONS EXPLAINED:

Keep API Keys Private: Never share your API keys or sensitive information with anyone. Keep them secret to prevent unauthorized access to your account.

Secure Password Entry: Ensure you enter the RAR archive password in a trusted and secure environment, free from keyloggers or malware.

Secure API Key Storage: Store your API keys and password-protected RAR archive in a secure location on your local machine, accessible only to you.

Regularly Update Passwords: Periodically update your passwords, both for your Binance account and the RAR archive.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA for your Binance account to add an extra layer of security.

Secure Execution Environment: Run the code on a trusted and secure computer or virtual environment.

Code Review: Review the code for any vulnerabilities before running it, and only use scripts from trusted sources.

Limit API Permissions: When creating API keys on Binance, limit their permissions to only what your script requires (e.g., trading and accessing market data).

### INSTALLATION EXPLAINED:

Install Python: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system.

Install Required Libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries by running the following commands:

pip install backtrader
pip install python-binance

Create Config File: Create a protected_config.rar file containing your config.ini with your Binance API keys. Make sure it's password-protected.

Place Files: Place the protected_config.rar file and the Python script (provided above) in the same directory.

Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run the script using the command:

python script_name.py

Choose Mode: The script will prompt you to choose a mode: backtest or live. Select the desired mode.

Follow Instructions: Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the RAR archive password and see the backtesting or live trading results.

Please ensure you understand the code, the security precautions, and the steps provided before proceeding. Always prioritize security and exercise caution when handling sensitive information.
